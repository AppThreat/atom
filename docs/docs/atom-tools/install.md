# Installing Atom-tools

Running `atom-tools` requires the `atom` project.

## Install atom

This program does not generate slices; its purpose is to manipulate slices generated by atom. The
current documentation for atom is housed in
the [AppThreat/atom](https://github.com/AppThreat/atom?tab=readme-ov-file) GitHub repository.

Atom can easily be installed from
a [native image](https://github.com/AppThreat/atom#atom-native-image) or via
npm 
```bash
npm install -g @appthreat/atom
```

## Atom-tools installation

```bash
pip install atom-tools
```
