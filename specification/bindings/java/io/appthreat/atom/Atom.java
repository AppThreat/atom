The field `IS_EXTERNAL` indicates whether it was possible to identify a method body for the method. This is true for methods that are defined in the source program, and false for methods that are dynamically linked to the program, that is, methods that exist in an external dependency.
   * Line and column number information is specified in the optional fields `LINE_NUMBER`, `COLUMN_NUMBER`, `LINE_NUMBER_END`, and `COLUMN_NUMBER_END` and the name of the source file is specified in `FILENAME`. An optional hash value MAY be calculated over the function contents and included in the `HASH` field.
   * Finally, the fully qualified name of the program constructs that the method is immediately contained in is stored in the `AST_PARENT_FULL_NAME` field and its type is indicated in the `AST_PARENT_TYPE` field to be one of `METHOD`, `TYPE_DECL` or `NAMESPACE_BLOCK`.
